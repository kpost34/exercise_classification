# **Exercise Classification Project**
Machine learning model using movement data.

## Introduction
Six participants with accelerometers placed on their belts, forearms, arms, and dumbbells performed exercises while movement data were recorded during a study by Velloso et al. (2013). The aim of this project was to develop a machine learning model to classify the exercise type (classe).
